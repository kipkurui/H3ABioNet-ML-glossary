The computer learns from data input, and then uses the learning to classify new observations into different groups. This may be simple (bi-class) like whether a person is male or female; or multiclass e.g. document classification. Some examples include: Linear classifiers (logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes classifier), Support Vector Machines, Decision Treess, Boosted Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Nearest Neighbour.
