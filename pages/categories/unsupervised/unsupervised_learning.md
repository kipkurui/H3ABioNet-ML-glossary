Unsupervised learning algorithms are used where there is no target or outcome variable to predict, and the primary aim is to identify clusters of (or stratify) the items in a dataset according to specific features or characteristics. The algorithm learns to identify patterns in the data without human guidance about how the different clusters should be determined.
Unsupervised learning can be categorized into 
* [clustering]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/categories/unsupervised/clustering/clustering.md %})
* [dimensionality reduction]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/categories/unsupervised/dimensionality_reduction/dimensionality_reduction.md %})
