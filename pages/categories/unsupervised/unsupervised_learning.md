Unsupervised learning algorithms are used where there is no target or outcome variable to predict, and the primary aim is to identify clusters of (or stratify) the items in a dataset according to specific features or characteristics. The algorithm learns to identify patterns in the data without human guidance about how the different clusters should be determined.
