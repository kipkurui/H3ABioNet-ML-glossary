Feature selection can be used to filter uninformative features from the dataset, and will keep a subset of the original features. Some supervised algorithms have inbuilt feature selection, e.g. random forests and regularised regression (Ridge regression and Lasso regression). Other feature selection approaches include variance thresholds, correlation thresholds, genetic algorithms, stepwise search.

Feature extraction will make a new set of features from combinations of the original features. It can be unsupervised (e.g. Principal component analysis, PCA) or supervised (e.g. Linear discriminant analysis, LDA).
