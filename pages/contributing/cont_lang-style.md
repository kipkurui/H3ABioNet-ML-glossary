## Tips {#tips}

This is not a holistic list, but a start!

1. Use a consistent writing style for a given machine learning term
2. Use footnotes for citations and bibliography. This eases the task of finding the said cited reference
3. Glossary terms: Identify common abbreviations and key words for tooltip expansion. This helps a first time user know readily what they stand for
4. When mentioning machine learning terms, try to provide either links or proper citation details
5. Comment on common misconcetions where available
